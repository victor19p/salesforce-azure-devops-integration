# Salesforce - Azure DevOps Integration
*Complete Enterprise Integration Solution with Evolution Phases*

## 📋 Project Overview

A comprehensive bi-directional integration solution that demonstrates **evolutionary development thinking** - starting from manual user-driven workflows and scaling to enterprise-grade automated synchronization. This project showcases the complete journey from MVP to production-scale solution.

> **Note**: This is a sanitized version of a real production integration developed for an enterprise client. All sensitive business information and proprietary configurations have been generalized while maintaining the technical implementation details.

## 🎯 Business Problem & Evolution

Organizations using Salesforce for customer case management and Azure DevOps for development workflow face integration challenges that evolve over time:

### Initial Challenge (Phase 1)
- Manual data entry between systems
- Lack of real-time synchronization
- Time-consuming manual linking processes

### Scale Challenge (Phase 2)  
- Growing volume of work items requiring sync
- Need for automated, scheduled synchronization
- Performance optimization for bulk operations

## 🚀 Solution Architecture: Two-Phase Evolution

### Phase 1: Manual Integration Foundation
**Interactive, user-driven workflow integration**

```
📱 LWC Forms → 🔧 Service Layer → 🌐 Azure API → 💾 Salesforce Storage
```

**Key Features:**
- On-demand work item creation
- Interactive case-to-work item linking
- Real-time bidirectional updates
- Metadata-driven field mapping

### Phase 2: Automated Synchronization
**Enterprise-scale automated sync with optimization**

```
⏰ Scheduler → 📦 Batch Processing → 🔄 Queueable Chains → 📊 Change Detection
```

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled bulk synchronization
- Change detection optimization
- Batch API utilization
- Performance monitoring
